Machine Learning Project: Breast Cancer Prediction

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts whether a cell is malignant or benign based on provided data. We utilize the Logistic Regression algorithm to achieve this classification task.

Steps:

1. Data Exploration - Explore and understand the dataset. Analyze features, distributions, and relationships between variables.

2. Data Preprocessing - Handle missing values (if there's any), encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

3. Model Training - Dividing data for training, validating and testing. Train the Logistic Regression model using the preprocessed data.

4. Model Evaluation - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

5. Result - Achieved a model with 99% accuracy and low Type II error, but still higher than Type I error (which could be a problem).

The breast_cancer_notebook contains comments that explain the majority of the code. It also provides explanations for the reasoning behind specific steps.
